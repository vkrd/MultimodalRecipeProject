16) (Don't worry that the chicken will still be a little uncooked, it finishes cooking in the sauce).
17) Pour the sauce into a blender or food processor, or use an immersion blender, and process until smooth.
18) Pour back into the skillet and bring back up to a boil.
19) Add the chicken and fenugreek leaves, if using.
20) Take the heat down to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes.
21) Add the cream and stir through.
22) Garnish with minced fresh cilantro, and serve over rice, with naan, or a crusty piece of bread!
23) Throw the garlic, ginger, and canola oil in a mini-food processor and let it go until it forms a semi-smooth paste.
24) There will still be tiny little pieces in there, but overall, it should resemble a paste.
25) Save what you don't use in a small glass jar.
26) It should last in the fridge for 2 to 3 weeks.
27) It's a delicious addition to marinades, pasta sauces, stir fry sauces, slow-cooker recipes, gravy etc.
28) We always had a jar of this stuff in our fridge growing up.
