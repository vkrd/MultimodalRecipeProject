 This super-silky chocolate frosting does not melt or run anywhere!

 3 sliced celery ribs 
 1 (16 ounce) egg noodles

Instructions: 
In a large stock pot place the cleaned whole chicken and fill the pot with GOOD water about 3 inches above the chicken. 
 I also add a Bay leaf. 
 Bring to a boil on high heat and continue boiling for about 1-1 1/2 hours until chicken is completely cooked. 
 Remove the chicken and let it cool off and skim the broth for any bones or fat and remove. 
 To the broth add the chicken bouillion and then add the vegetables. 
 ( I add mushrooms in place of the celery or sometimes just carrots. 
 Use whatever vegetables you like). 
 Let the vegetables cook until almost tender. 
 While vegetables are cooking remove chicken from the bone and shred and add to the soup. 
 When the vegetables have become tender add in the noodles. 
 (I use Grandmas noodles which can be found in the frozen section usually near the frozed bread dough.) 
 Wait for the noodles to completely cook and then the soup is done and ready to eat. 
 You can add water anytime during the cooking stage if the water looks like it is boiling down too low. 
 This is one of those recipes that you can make it your own.

RECIPE 2 - Easy Kimchi
Ingredients: 
1 whole Napa Cabbage, Cut Into Quarters And Then Into 1 Inch Pieces 
 1 whole Daikon Radish, Thinly Sliced (use A Mandolin) 
 2 whole Large Carrots, Thinly Sliced (use A Mandolin) 
 1 Tablespoon Honey 
 2 Tablespoons Fresh Ginger, Finely Grated 
 1/4 cups Fish Sauce 
 4 Tablespoons Crushed Red Pepper (more If You Can Handle Heat, I Use About 1/4 Cup) 
 4 cloves Garlic, Finely Grated (more If You'd Like, I Aim To Get About 1 Tablespoon) 
 18 cups Kosher Salt

Instructions: 
1. 
 In a large bowl, add the cabbage, radish and carrots. 
 2. 
 In a small bowl, add the remaining ingredients and stir to create a paste. 
 3. 
 Add the paste to the vegetables and toss to completely coat. 
 4. 
 Let the mixture sit for an hour or more, tossing every 15-20 minutes. 
 This creates the brine to start the fermenting process. 
 5. 
 Transfer the kimchi to a glass jar with a rubber seal lid (though any jar will do). 
 Make sure you pack it in tightly, leaving about an inch space as the brine will increase in volume as it ferments. 
 6. 
 Leave on your counter for 4 days then transfer to your fridge for two weeks. 
 Kimchi will practically last forever. 
 This is a non-traditional recipe as you can see that I didnt use Korean chilies. 
 You can, of course, but I just use what I had on hand. 
 Tip: While your jar is on the counter fermenting, place a plate under it in case your jar overflows as mine does on occasion. 
 Enjoy!

 14 cup sugar 
 1 large egg 
 2 large egg yolks 
 1 12 teaspoons salt 
 4 -4 14 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus 
 additional unbleached all-purpose flour, for dusting work surface 
 8 ounces cream cheese, softened but still cool 
 2 tablespoons corn syrup 
 2 tablespoons heavy cream 
 1 cup confectioners' sugar, sifted to remove any lumps 
 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 
 34 cup packed light brown sugar 
 3 tablespoons quality ground cinnamon (either Penzeys or McCormick or Schilling) 
 18 teaspoon salt

Instructions: 
For the dough:. 
 Heat the milk and butter in a small pan until the butter melts. 
 Remove the pan from the heat and set aside until the mixture is lukewarm (about 100 degrees). 
 In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle, mix together the water, yeast, sugar, egg, and yolks at low speed until well mixed. 
 Add the salt, warm milk mixture, and 2 cups of the flour and mix at medium speed until thoroughly blended. 
 Switch to the dough hook, add another 2 cups of the flour, and knead at medium speed (adding up to 1/4 cup more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time if necessary), I did use the additional 1/4 cup of flour, until the dough is smooth and freely clears the sides of the bowl, about 10 minutes. 
 Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured work surface. 
 Shape the dough into a round, place it in a very lightly oiled bowl, and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. 
 Leave in a warm draft free spot until doubled in bulk, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. 
 While dough is raising prepare the icing:. 
 Combine all of the icing ingredients in the bowl of a standing mixer and blend together at low speed until thoroughly combined. 
 Increase the speed to high and mix until the icing is smooth and free of cream cheese lumps. 
 Transfer the icing to a small bowl, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. 
 To roll and fill the dough:. 
 After the dough has doubled, press it down and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. 
 Using a rolling pin, shape the dough into a 16 by 12 inch rectangle, with long side facing you. 
 Mix together the filling ingredients in a small bowl and sprinkle the filling evenly over the dough, leaving a 1/2 inch border at the far edge. 
 Roll the dough, beginning with the long edge closest to you and using both hands to pinch the dough with your fingertips as you roll. 
 Keep it tightly rolled. 
 Moisten the top border with water and seal the roll. 
 Lightly dust the roll with flour and press on the ends if necessary to make a uniform 16 inch cylinder. 
 Grease a 13 x 9 inch baking dish or spray with cooking spray. 
 Cut the rolls into 12 equal pieces using plain dental floss or a sharp knife. 
 Place the rolls cut side up, evenly in the prepared baking dish. 
 Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm draft free spot until doubled in bulk 1 1/2- 2 hours.

 Gently press it into a 9-inch pie pan and crimp edges with your forefinger and thumb. 
 Prick the bottom of the pie crust all over with the tines of a fork to keep it from puffing up in the oven. 
 Refrigerate until well chilled, about 45 minutes. 
 Put the sweet potatoes on a baking sheet and bake in the oven until very tender, about 45 minutes. 
 Turn the oven down to 350 degrees F and remove potatoes from oven; allow to cool slightly before scooping the flesh into a food processor. 
 Puree until smooth, then add the eggs, cream, brown sugar, sugar syrup and vanilla extract. 
 Pulse a couple of times to combine, then add the cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. 
 Put the pie pan on a rimmed baking sheet and pour in the filling.

 Remove from the stovetop and let cool for 5 minutes.

 Cool until topping has hardened, about 20 minutes. 
 Serve.

 Combine the flour, ground pecans, sugar and salt in a large bowl. 
 Add the butter and rub the butter pieces between your fingertips and thumbs, or use a pastry blender, until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. 
 Pour in the ice water and work it in until the dough holds together, being careful not to overmix. 
 Squeeze a small amount together; if it is too crumbly, add some more ice water, a little at a time. 
 Shape it into a smooth ball, flatten into a disk, and wrap in plastic wrap. 
 Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, and up to 2 days.
